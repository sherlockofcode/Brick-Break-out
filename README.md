GAME description:
In the game, there are rows of bricks in the top of the screen. The objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks with a small ball that travels across the screen. A brick is destroyed when hit by the ball.The ball bounces off when hits the screen borders, the bricks and the paddle. The player must avoid the ball to touch the bottom of the screen (or in common words, falling to the ground). To prevent this from happening, the player uses the paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play.

Your score increases when you destroy bricks. On the other hand, you lose one life each time the ball falls in the ground.
